  "Hello friends, I am going to start our course on algorithms. Algorithms as a subject. Algorithms are a common subject for computer science engineering students. Most of the universities offer this course as a part of syllabus. And this is a very core subject and very important subject. And students face some difficulties in some of the topics in this one. They could not understand them very clearly. So here I am going to make the subject more and more simple so that you can easily understand at the UN you can practice that and also remember it easily. The importance of the subject is that apart from theoretical examination it is also important for competitive exams. And even programming contest most of them are designed from this subject only. If any programming challenges there they are m",
  "ostly difficult to questions from this subject. So this is one of the challenges something for the student because they get a chance to solve different type of problems and they get the strategy or approach for solving the problem. So some students fail to understand it properly so they could not get the approach for the strategy for solving the problems. And they feel that they are lacking in the logic development or strategy development of a program. So I will be covering in-depth each and everything right from the basics to the depth. So that you will be able to answer any type of question from this one. I will cover the topic such that just you look at the question you can get asked. That I guarantee you right. So the thing is I will cover those points which are useful for solving the ",
  "questions. Some job interviews or even for any other exam or some entrance exams like gate exam the questions are framed from algorithms also but there is also one of the key subject there. So you will be able to answer any type of question from there. To ask the lectures in the order I will be giving the numbers for each topic so that you follow that order you follow the sequence because I may be breaking the major topic in close more topics. I got more important thing this you feedback is very important for me because already I have made few prepared few videos using presentations and other tools but now I am giving a lecture on whiteboard so maybe I am new for the video quality and audio quality all these things. So technically once I get set up so I need your feedback so I can make my ",
  "videos more and more better. So your feedback is important for me to know how the video quality and audio quality you are getting it on your devices because I have checked on different devices and I found that the results are different so what devices you are using what I should improve, voice or what so I need your feedback. Let us start with just introduction what is an Elkortam? What is an Elkortam? Why is it written? When it is written? Who will write it? Let us get the answers for these. See algorithm as a definition it is a common definition everybody knows that is a step by step procedure for solving a computational problem. Yes it is a step by step procedure for solving a computational problem then what is the program? Program is also a step by step procedure for solving a problem ",
  "then what is the difference between program and Elkortam? So by comparing program and Elkortam I can make you understand the importance of Elkortam meaning of Elkortam. Let us take it. Here is an Elkortam and here is a program. Let us see the first thing, first difference. If you know the software development life cycle, the phases of developing a software project, in the phases of development or software project there are two important phases, design phase and the implementation phase. If you are not aware of it let me tell you whatever you want to manufacture or construct something by engineering procedures then first step one of the important step is designing. First you know designing, make your design perfect and thorough so that you can understand what you are going to construct what",
  " you are going to develop and you are sure what you are going to develop then you start the development. You can't develop anything you cannot construct anything on trial and error basis like you constructed something again in the north, wrong, destroyed and again create a new one. So no, what it is easy in software engineering. Software engineer can write some program and change the mind, delete the program and again start writing the program. So that's why we cannot get a feel that we have wasted a month so much amount of time in writing so useless program. So the point is first you design and then you write the program. So after design time what do you use? So you are not writing a program then what do you write? So that same program we write it in simple English like statements that ar",
  "e easy to understand without using proper syntax and we may not be writing on machine that is on computer we may be writing on paper or even if you are using a machine also then you will not be writing in some language you can even be writing in MS Word or notepad like application. So just you are getting familiar how your program going to work so that's nothing but an algorithm. So algorithm also are written at design time and then the programs are written they are written at implementation time, design time and implementation time. So first you make a design what your procedure is going to do what your software is going to do come up with some design and that design you can put into a program. Then what do you call to a person who do designing without program? Where does that? Yes if pro",
  "grammer is capable of doing that he can do it otherwise the person who will do this one should have the domain knowledge, the problems knowledge, knowledge about the problem and its solution. He can give a solution the one who understands the problem and has the domain knowledge. Suppose your development is software or an algorithm or a program for account then accountant can understand accounting better or if you are writing an application or developing application for hospital then doctors or the administrative staff of a hospital can understand the system better than a programmer. So mostly the one who is hiring a knowledge about the domain for which the application is being developed they can write on their algorithm. So the person who writes should have domain knowledge. Who will writ",
  "e the program? Program so programmers can also have domain knowledge they can also have domain knowledge that he is acting as a designer and here he is acting as a programmer. Next what is the language used for writing algorithm? You can use any language. Any language, any language with English-Lit language or you can use some mathematical rotations if you are writing English-Lit language it will be like writing parrots or somebody but don't try if you want you can use mathematical rotations also it's better if you use mathematical rotations. So any language can use any language with English-Lit language or some mathematical notations can be used as long as it is understandable five those people who are using that. Like if a designer has written a algorithm the programmer will be writing a",
  " program for it. So designers should understand and also programmer should understand that form. So the team of programmers who are working on that project should be able to understand it. Then this is written only using programming language. Like C C++ Java Python. So you can use different languages for developing a program. Next one more important thing here is when you write an algorithm it's going to be hardware and software means operating system independent. It's not dependent on hardware what's machine you are going to use what's the configuration of the machine and what's the operating system with the linear software, the windows operating system we don't bother about it. But when you write a program it is dependent on hardware and operating system. So when you develop the program ",
  "you have to select some hardware on which you are going to run and also you have to select some operating system you may be doing it for Linux or you may be doing it for Windows. So the method will be different and the environment's had different. So it is important. Next, after writing an algorithm we analyze, analyze an algorithm. Means you will study the algorithm to find out are we achieving the results perfectly or not and our algorithm is efficient or not in terms of time and space we will see what does it mean by now and answers. So we will analyze an algorithm. What do we do with the program? So you don't have to study the program, all the programs there just run it and check it. So we don't testing, testing of the programs. That's it. These are few differences between algorithm an",
  "d program. These differences will help you understand what are algorithms. All right. Now one more thing I will tell you, the syntax of the language that we use, any language can be used but who actually write algorithms and who use them and who write the programs of programmers who are coming from university graduates. Mostly, university graduate knows at least sea language. So not is mostly in the name of algorithm we write sea language program only. So the benefit is that the advantage is that everybody knows sea language now. So instead of writing some other language to confuse, we can use sea language all this so that everybody can understand. So even at a school level sea language has been taught so everybody is familiar with sea language. So I will be using sea language syntax for w",
