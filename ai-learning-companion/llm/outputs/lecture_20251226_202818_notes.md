## Key Concepts

- Hello friends, I am going to start our course on algorithms.
- Algorithms as a subject.
- Algorithms are a common subject for computer science engineering students.
- Most of the universities offer this course as a part of syllabus.
- And this is a very core subject and very important subject.
- And students face some difficulties in some of the topics in this one.
- They could not understand them very clearly.
- So here I am going to make the subject more and more simple so that you can easily understand at the UN you can practice that and also remember it easily.

## Details

- The importance of the subject is that apart from theoretical examination it is also important for competitive exams.
- And even programming contest most of them are designed from this subject only.
- If any programming challenges there they are m.
- ostly difficult to questions from this subject.
- So this is one of the challenges something for the student because they get a chance to solve different type of problems and they get the strategy or approach for solving the problem.
- So some students fail to understand it properly so they could not get the approach for the strategy for solving the problems.
- And they feel that they are lacking in the logic development or strategy development of a program.
- So I will be covering in-depth each and everything right from the basics to the depth.

## Summary
- This lecture covers the above key points.
